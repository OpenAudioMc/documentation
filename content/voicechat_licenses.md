# Licenses
VoiceChat uses a licensing system, and every server attempts to obtain a free license when starting. This allows you to use up to 10 free concurrent slots, but has to be refreshed every day, so it could be that voicechat is temporarily unavailable for your server. You can keep a free license for a month at a time if you link your craftmend account, or unlock more slots, special features and remove limitations if you're a patreon supporter
You're also able to disable Voice Chat in specific parts of your world through world guard, which is useful to discourage abuse and noise in busy areas or in spaces where you don't want it to distract from your servers gameplay. To do this, open the region GUI as explained [here](regions.md) and click the "disable voice chat" button.
