# Hosted Client
OpenAudioMc gives you the option to host your own client, however, there are some caveats
- You will become responsible for frequent updates, meaning that you have to update your webclient regularly.
- You will have to follow the rules as described [here](https://account.craftmend.com/terms).
- We do not recommend that you host the client yourself and will not help you setting it up aside from this document.

# Setup
1. Clone the OpenAudioMc [repository](https://github.com/Mindgamesnl/OpenAudioMc) (or download it as a zip file) 
2. Upload the pre-compiled client (in `docs/production-client/target/`) to your webserver.
3. Login to your [Account](account.md), go to your servers settings page and change the client url to where you uploaded yours, then save.
4. Execute `/oa reload`
5. Generate a new URL by re-joining the server.

# Compiling your own JS bundle
