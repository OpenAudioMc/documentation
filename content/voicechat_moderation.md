# Moderation
OpenAudioMc has native support for:
 - Essentials player mutes
 - Litebans player mutes

and comes with built-in moderation utilities. Moderators can inspect a player by running `/oa voice mod <name>`,(like `/oa voice mod Mindgamesnl`) and the plugin will load a GUI showing names of the 15 most recent players that they talked to, when they were last seen, as well as allowing you to ban them from using Proximity Voice Chat at all.
