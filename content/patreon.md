OpenAudioMc has always been a hobby project that I ran in my spare time ever since it launched <b>5 years</b> ago.
I love to spend time on the project, expanding it, improving it and growing it to be a mature application for everyone to use, and we've come a long day since our release in 2016.
<br />
The ugly truth is though, that hosting a project like this requires a lot of attention during times when I might not have all the spare time in the world (during exams, etc), and with the projects insane growth over the last two years, the hosting costs have skyrocketed.

<br />
My amazing patreons are the ones who keep the project going, enable me to spend a lot of extra time on it and keep the show financially stable. They get a few pretty neat perks in return, like:
<br />
 - Access to the patreon channels in discord with early previews, prioritized support and awful dad-jokes
 - Prioritized API access, ensuring that their service will skip the queue when our servers are busy
 - Extra voicechat slots, enabling their bigger community to grow while also enabling the free users to enjoy OpenAudioMc
 - Access to local file streaming and increased CDN access
 - Streamer mode, protecting URL's and sessions when shown on stream
 - A cool green tag in our Discord
 - Support for video (mp4) backgrounds in their web client
 - My love, honestly, NONE of this would be possible without my supporters and that's something that means more to me than I can express <3
