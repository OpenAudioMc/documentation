# Web Client
The web client (also known as the website) is the page that makes the magic work. Minecraft doesn't support audio streaming itself, so the web client is a web page which users must leave open in the background during their visit on your server to hear all sounds.

Users get prompted with a clickable link when joining to open the client, but can also manually re-generate a link using `/audio`, `/connect` or `/media` (they all do exactly the same, just whatever fits your server style the best)

## Pro tip!
It may be a bit annoying to go back and forth between Minecraft and the webclient to get the volume just right, so you can do `/volume` to adjust the volume from in game!
