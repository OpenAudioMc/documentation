# Voice Chat
Proximity Voice Chat is one of the core OpenAudioMc features. It allows players to others within a configurable radius. They can hear the whereabouts of others through spatial audio, which is incredibly fun for SMP's, Minigames, Roleplay, and so much more.

### Commands
Voice chat exposes a few commands to the end user (other than the regular `/audio` command), these can be used while their voice chat session is active to easily control their experience without leaving the game.
- `/mutemic`, `/micmute` and `/mm` are quick in-game commands to mute their own microphone, players receive confirmations in chat when their state gets changed.
