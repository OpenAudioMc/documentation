  Permissions
</h1>
<p>
  OpenAudioMc has permissions for everything and is fully configurable.
  <br>
  If you donâ€™t want to bother with permissions, you can give yourself OP (or
  <code>
    openaudiomc.*
  </code>
  on bungeecord) and be done with it, or dive into the specifics.

<h1 id="commands">
  Commands
</h1>
<p>
  OpenAudioMc command permissions have their own wildcard for all the permissions (
  <code>
    openaudiomc.commands.*
  </code>
  ), this will give you access to all the admin commands.
</p>
<p>
  You can also (dis)allow specific commands, the format for this is
  <code>
    openaudiomc.commands.&lt;sub command&gt;
  </code>
  , where the sub command is the second argument in your OpenAudioMc command.
  <br>
  Example: you need
  <code>
    openaudiomc.commands.region
  </code>
  to use
  <code>
    /oa region create
  </code>
  .
  <br>

  Speakers
</h1>
<p>
  Speakers have their own two commands for breaking and placing the blocks.
  <br>
  To allow all speaker interactions, you need,
  <code>
    openaudiomc.speakers.*
  </code>
  .
</p>
<p>
  The specific permissions are:
  <br>
