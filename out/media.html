  OpenAudioMc supports multiple file formats for your sounds, these are:
  <br>
  - Local audio (from
  <code>
    plugins/OpenAudioMc/audio/
  </code>
  )
  <br>
  - Direct file links (mp3, ogg, wav, etc)
  <br>
  - SoundCloud
  <br>
  - YouTube
</p>
<p>
  <br/>

  Local Audio
</h1>
<p>
  Patreon’s are able to play audio files through stored in their plugins folder. File names can’t include spaces, but you use subdirectories. Simply prefix your source in a command with
  <code>
    local:
  </code>
  and we’ll automatically convert, optimize and upload the sources for you. Make sure that your server is compatible with
  <a href="restdirect.html" rel="nofollow">
    RestDirect
  </a>
  !
</p>
<p>
  Example:
  <code>
    /oa play @a local:themidnight-monsters.mp3
  </code>
  , which will be read from
  <code>
    plugins/OpenAudioMc/audio/themidnight-monsters.mp3
  </code>
  <br>
  <br/>

  Random media and Playlists.

<p>
  You might want to shake things up a little every once in a while by assigning random sounds to a region, command or whatever. You can simply do this by stringing multiple sources in a JSON array, so you’d enter something like
  <code>
    [&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oddp32TODKs&#34;,&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBCLsnxNd4Y&#34;]
  </code>
  instead of your singular source. The client will choose a random sound from the list when the media is requested to start.
  <br>
  Randomized media with looping tags will reselect their source every time they loop, functioning like a playlist.
  <br>

<p>
  The OpenAudioMc audio format is what’s being used throughout the network. It contains the source, and a UNIX timestamp for when the command was executed. This is defined by the plugin and does NOT get changed anywhere further on in the process.
</p>
<p>
  Other optional metadata included:
  <br>
  -
  <strong>
    <code>
      fadeTime
    </code>
    (number)
  </strong>
  : Time for the sound to fade in (in MS)
  <br>
  -
  <strong>
    <code>
      id
    </code>
    (text)
  </strong>
  : The ID that will be assigned to the sound. This can be used to stop one specific sound later.
  <br>
  -
  <strong>
    <code>
      loop
    </code>
    (true/false)
  </strong>
  : Decide whether the sound should restart after finishing or not. This will mean that the sound will keep playing until manually stopped.
  <br>
  -
  <strong>
    <code>
      pickUp
    </code>
    (true/false)
  </strong>
  : Decides if the sound should continue (AKA Sync) between sessions and players
  <br>
  -
  <strong>
    <code>
      expirationTimeout
    </code>
    (number)
  </strong>
  : The amount of time (in seconds) a sound should be kept for. Setting it to 120 will mean that the client will hear the sound, even if it connected after it started.
  <br>
  -
  <strong>
    <code>
      volume
    </code>
    (number)
  </strong>
  : A scaled volume level that will be used for the sound (so you can make sound effects quiet, etc)
</p>
<p>
  All the optional tags should be included in the Play command as a JSON object with the spaces left out, so a fully decked out argment would look like
</p><pre><code>{fadeTime:1500,id:&#34;station&#34;,loop:true,pickup:true,expirationTimeout:3600000,volume:50}
</code></pre>

  <em>
    Notes:
  </em>
  <br>
  - Youtube videos need to be public and big videos might not work. It’s best to upload your own.
  <br>
  - Some soundcloud artists block their music from being played on third party sites like OpenAudioMc, if a soundcloud song fails to play, its most likely this. You are best off uploading it to your own account (but be sure to set it to public)
  <br>
  - GoogleDrive and DropBox share url’s have to be public and permanent. Please note the permanent part, since it’d be a shame if your music suddenly stops playing.
</p>
<p>
  It is possible to add support for other sources as well. OpenAudioMc has a java api to add support for url manipulations. This means that there are add-on plugins like
  <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/openaudiomc-youtube-support.64584/" rel="nofollow">
    OpenAudioMc-Youtube
  </a>
  to expand the feature set with an alternative youtube engine.
