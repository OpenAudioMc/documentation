  NetherlandSMP is a dutch survival server started by Joost, bringing most Dutch content creators (youtubers and twitch streamers) together in one big survival multiplayer server. NetherlandSMP is the first real-world test of our Proximity Voice-Chat feature, working closely together with their feedback to improve reliability, features, latency and audio quality.

<p>
  SprookjesCraft is one of the leading Dutch themepark servers, dumping their own solution and switching to OpenAudioMc in late 2019, working closely to develop addons and extra features to fill in the gaps and providing resources to the OpenAudioMc project to keep it running for free (we still run on some of these resources to this day)

    BlockParty (1, 2 and 3)

<p>
  BlockParty was the biggest Minecraft music festival, OpenAudioMc was used to serve the web client on a large scale (serving over 2.3K clients for blockparty alone) and to run the lighting effects through the show (and later redis) feature (both got added while looking for problems that they faced).

<p>
  FallenMC was a Minecraft project between Timon and A6D, it wss a (still in development) large scale minecraft project that never really saw the light of day due to financial issues on the management side. OpenAudioMc was brought on board to develop the first Voice Chat solution that hooked into their minigames to bring a unique user experience. This feature eventually grew to be the proximity voice chat that you know today.
