  Media Aliases

<p>
  Source URL’S can get pretty long and may need replacement. Luckily, you can shorten them into aliases. This is like a shortcut for any given source.
</p>
<p>
  To start, you need to define an alias, for this example, we’ll make a sound called test
</p><pre><code>/openaudio alias test https://craftmend.com/mysound.mp3`
</code></pre>
<p>
  This means that every time we write a:test, we actually mean
  <a href="https://craftmend.com/mysound.mp3" rel="nofollow">
    https://craftmend.com/mysound.mp3
  </a>
  . You can use this alias as a source everywhere, regions, speakers, traincarts signs, play commands, you name it. Such an example play command is
</p><pre><code>/openaudio play @a a:test
</code></pre>
