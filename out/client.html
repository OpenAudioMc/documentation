  Hosted Client
</h1>
<p>
  OpenAudioMc gives you the option to host your own client, however, there are some caveats
  <br>
  - You will become responsible for frequent updates, meaning that you have to update your webclient regularly.
  <br>
  - You will have to follow the rules as described
  <a href="https://github.com/Mindgamesnl/OpenAudioMc/blob/master/LICENCE_and_PRIVACY.html" rel="nofollow">
    here
  </a>
  .
  <br>
  - We do not recommend that you host the client yourself and will not help you setting it up aside from this document.
