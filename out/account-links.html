  <li>
    Join the

    Go to the

    channel
    <br>

  <li>
    Get a
    <a href="https://account.craftmend.com/account/fingerprint" rel="nofollow">
      fingerprint from your account
    </a>
    (just like you did when linking your server)
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    Type
    <code>
      /setup &lt;your fingerprint&gt;
    </code>
    where you obviously replace

  Leaving the discord automatically unlinks your discord profile from your craftmend account and will revoke perks that you claimed through invites or give-aways.
