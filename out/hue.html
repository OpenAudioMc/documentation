  OpenAudioMc has a build in Philips-Hue integration this can be used to add real time lighting effects to your Minecraft server
  <br>
  The hue integration is designed to work with colors, but white lights are also supported (along with Led strips). When a hue bridge gets detected on the local network of a client, it will show a little bottom right corner.
</p>
<p>
  If the user clicks the button it prompts them though the setup process where they need to select a room. The messages for this setup can be changed in the config. If the user already linked their lights before, OpenAudioMc will automatically when connected.

  Commands
</h1>
<p>
  The OpenAudioMc command is used to change the colors and brightness of specific lights or groups.
</p>
<p>
  All color codes are explicitly in RGBA, with values for Red, Green, Blue and Brightness defined in a range from 0 to 255 . So red at max brightness will be 255 0 0 255 . The light selection is a Json array of integers that are mapped to the light id’s of the selected room. Example, the philips hue starter kit has 4 lights, to change all the lights the array would be [1,2,3,4] or if you would only want to change light 2 it is [2]
</p>
<p>
  The command follows the format of:
</p><pre><code>/openaudio hue set &lt;selector&gt; &lt;lights&gt; &lt;red&gt; &lt;green&gt; &lt;blue&gt; &lt;brightness&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
  Example, if I would want to change the lights of my setup to blue the command will be
</p><pre><code>/openaudio hue set Mindgamesnl [1,2,3] 0 0 255 255
</code></pre>
