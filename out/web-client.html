  Web Client
</h1>
<p>
  The web client (also known as the website) is the page that makes the magic work. Minecraft doesnâ€™t support audio streaming itself, so the web client is a web page which users must leave open in the background during their visit on your server to hear all sounds.
</p>
<p>
  Users get prompted with a clickable link when joining to open the client, but can also manually re-generate a link using
  <code>
    /audio
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
    /connect
  </code>
  or
  <code>
    /media
  </code>
  (they all do exactly the same, just whatever fits your server style the best)

  Pro tip!

<p>
  It may be a bit annoying to go back and forth between Minecraft and the webclient to get the volume just right, so you everyone can do
  <code>
    /volume
  </code>
  to adjust the volume from in game!
